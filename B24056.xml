            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the HONOURABLE the COMMONS of ENGLAND <hi>In Parliament Assembled.</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">A PROPOSAL Concerning the COIN of this Kingdom.</head>
            <p>WHEREAS the <hi>Great Difficulty,</hi> that appears in this Matter, proceeds from the Consideration, that the Calling in our <hi>Money</hi> [at this time] must Occasion a <hi>Great Stop</hi> in <hi>Trade;</hi> the Market thereby not able to be Supplied, besides the many further <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> that may naturally arise: Yet the Necessity for our Coin to be Regulated, is such, That it were much more eligible to be subject to the hazard of some Mischiefs, than not put a stop [in due time] to that growing <hi>Evil:</hi> which to prevent, it's Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Proposed, as an <hi>Expedient,</hi> to render it easy and practicable, from these four following Heads.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>BY Supplying our Market while our Money is a Coining.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>BY Making Good the Deficiency of the Mint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>BY Preserving our Mill'd and Broad Money, till the time of Calling in our Clipt Money.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>BY making EASY the FALL of Gold, which is [now] become the general and currant Cash of the Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Two First Heads, it's Propos'd:</p>
            <p>THAT a FUND (being made for a Lottery of a Million, or more, if thought fit, to be <hi>Advanced</hi> by such Persons only, as shall purchase their Interest, by bringing in <hi>Plate,</hi> forthwith, to be Coined before the Money be called in) would certainly Answer in lieu of <hi>Bullion,</hi> to give an immediate Supply to the Market, keep our Money circulating, and remove all Objections.</p>
            <p>THE Quantity of the <hi>Superfluous Plate</hi> in this Kingdom is so considerable, which, together with the Useless Plate in <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Houses,</hi> being Prohibited, it's not to be doubted, but a Million, or Two, might be soon Advanced.</p>
            <p>ESPECIALLY when we consider the Price that Plate now bares, and how desirous the People are of coming into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Lottery,</hi> as plainly appear'd by the <hi>Prizes</hi> and <hi>Blanks</hi> in the <hi>Million Adventure,</hi> when once past the hopes of another <hi>Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> the last Sessions, Advanc'd from <hi>Six</hi> Years Purchase to <hi>Seven</hi> and an half.</p>
            <p>THE Way and Method for all such Persons as shall be <hi>Proprietors</hi> in this <hi>Adventure</hi> is Propos'd, That they carry their Plate to the <hi>Mint,</hi> there to receive <hi>Tickets</hi> according to the Value, Accounting so many <hi>Ounces</hi> as shall be proportioned to a <hi>Ticket;</hi> and for every odd Sum that shall happen over and above, to receive a <hi>Note</hi> for the same, Payable at a certain time, after Coining.</p>
            <p>BUT if it shall be thought fit to have such Plate brought into the <hi>Bank,</hi> thence to be Transmitted to the <hi>Mint,</hi> to return in Coin; the <hi>Mint</hi> will be greatly eas'd, considering the Work upon their hands, and the Money made much more <hi>Defusive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR the <hi>Bank</hi> thereby being enabled to answer the Defficiency of the <hi>Mint,</hi> all Persons of Worth and Credit, that shall bring their Money to be Coin'd, will readily take <hi>Notes</hi> upon the <hi>Bank,</hi> for what shall fall short; which being for their ease, and having a free Credit, the <hi>Million</hi> or more in <hi>Specie</hi> will remain in the <hi>Bank</hi> to supply the Poorer sort of People, that can afford no Credit, having no more than bare Subsistance.</p>
            <p>SO consequently the <hi>Bank</hi> will supply the <hi>Mint,</hi> and the <hi>Mint</hi> be able to supply the <hi>Bank</hi> before Occasion: Therefore no possibility of <hi>Stoppage</hi> in <hi>Commerce,</hi> or want of Current Money.</p>
            <p>BY these means, not only the present Occasion is answered, by Facilitating the <hi>Coynage</hi> of all the Money, but a <hi>Million</hi> or more in Specie is created; without which, it's directly sinking a <hi>Million,</hi> or more, from what was in the <hi>Nation</hi> before, which is conceiv'd can hardly be spared at this time.</p>
            <p>AS to the Third Head, by preserving our Mill'd and Broad Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT cannot be supposed the Million, or more, that arises from the Plate brought into this Lottery, can be compleated, and turned into Coin in less than Twelve Months; therefore may be Naturally Objected, That all our Mill'd and Broad Money, will either be melted down, or clipt in that time.</p>
            <p>IT's Answered thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That if the Parliament shall, in their Wisdom, think fit to give Encouragement to all Persons, that shall bring in such Money into His Majesty's Exchequer by a certain time; and shall allow Bills of Credit to be issued out from thence, to pass as Payment till such time as the same is Coin'd; would certainly preserve it from being Clip'd, or Debas'd, and add greatly to the Circulation of Trade; giving hereby a supply for Commerce of so much as now lyes buried, and of nouse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS to the Fourth Head, by making easie the fall of Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOLD being the general Cash of the Nation, will certainly affect the poor and middle sort of people most: And upon a sudden, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere fall, it may occasion a greater Inconvenience than at present can be imagin'd, or fit to be inserted: Though some may say [as Gold did rise, so let it fall] yet this Answer tends not (with submission) to the quiet of the Government, or to the ease of the Subject. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in tenderness to both, It's humbly Proposed, That if this <hi>Honourable House</hi> shall adjudge it necessary to settle the price of Guineas, <hi>viz.</hi> That from Week to Week, or from Month to Month, proportionably, they shall gradually fall Two Pence <hi>per</hi> Guinea: By these Means the Loss will be easy; and that which must render it the more acceptable, will be the Natural Force of Payments; and the greatest Loss will Center among those that have been the greatest Gainers, <hi>viz.</hi> the Hoarders of our Coin.</p>
            <p>SO that upon a Calculation, in a Years time, or less, One or Two Millions may be Coined in Specie from the Plate, (if thought conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to grant a Fund for so much) besides the Mill'd and Broad Money, that certainly will be brought into the Exchequer, upon such Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, which may modestly be computed not to be less than Ten or Twelve Hundred Thousand Pounds. THE whole then amounting to near Three Millions; it cannot but be allowed as sufficient to Answer the immediate demands, upon our Clipt Money being call'd in: And by that time we shall be ready to Exchange our Silver; Gold, by the Gentle Fall of Two Pence a Week, or proportionably <hi>per</hi> Month, will come to its old Center.</p>
            <p>IN the mean time the <hi>Money</hi> that passes, which is almost Impossible to be made worse; and some part of the <hi>Gold</hi> we have being quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, together with the Bills Issued out from the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> for what <hi>Moneys</hi> shall be brought in; besides, the Advantages of Bank Credit will certainly maintain our Trade in a free Circulation; considering our Support (for this Year past) has been by the same means, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Addition of Coining Notes from the Exchequer, for above a <hi>Million,</hi> and more; which is the least that can be expected to be brought in, upon a Consideration given by this <hi>Honourable House.</hi>
